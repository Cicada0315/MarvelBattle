Project Requirements

1.Provide a CLI
2.Your CLI application must provide access to data from a web page.
3.The data provided must go at least one level deep. A "level" is where a user can make a choice and then get detailed information about their choice. Some examples are below:
    Movies opening soon - Enter your zip code and receive a list of movies and their details.
    Libraries near you - Enter your zip code and receive a list of libraries and their details.
    Programming meetups near you - Choose from an events list and receive details.
    News reader - List articles and read an article of your choosing.
4.Your CLI application should not be too similar to the Ruby final projects (Music Library CLI, Tic-Tac-Toe with AI, Student Scraper). Also, please refrain from using Kickstarter as that was used for the scraping 'code along'.

5.Use good OO design patterns. You should be creating a collection of objects, not hashes, to store your data. Pro 

Tip: Avoid scraping data more than once per web page - utilize objects you have already created. It will speed up your program!
